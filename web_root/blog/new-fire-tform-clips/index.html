<h1 class=title>New Fire Transformation Clips!</h1>

<h2 id="the-wavedash">Wavedash Clip</h2>
<p>
We can clip into stadium using a well timed wavedash here.
This is well known and commonly done on accident.

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/wavedash-clip.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>
Clip: Move into the corner. Jump and f1 airdodge down right.

<p>
If our character don't have a tether, this clip is bad.
Using an airdodge to clip causes us to enter special fall and fall to our death.
We die with no way to recover or have fun inside the stage.
We want to be actionable after clipping.

<h2 id="airdodge-item-throw">Airdodge Item Throw?</h2>

<p>
We can cancel the first 3 frames of airdodge with an item throw.
This is called an airdodge item throw (or an aerial glide toss, but I think that's a bad name).
Can we use that here to become actionable after the wavedash clip?

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/wavedash-clip-glide-toss.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>
Clip: Move into the corner. Jump and f1 airdodge down right. Item throw in the first 3 frames of airdodge.

<p>
No. An airdodge item throw retains our velocity from before the airdodge.
The jump velocity makes us pop up from beneath the stage.

<p>
This could work if we could stop our vertical momentum before the airdodge.
And Peach has just the tool! Her double jump!

<h2 id="airdodge-item-throw-clip">DJ Airdodge Item Throw Clip</h2>

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/dj-glide-toss-clip.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>
Clip: Move into the corner. Jump and f1 double jump, then f1 airdodge down right. Item throw in the first 3 frames of airdodge.

<p>
This clip works but it's very hard.
It requires a frame perfect double jump, a frame perfect airdodge,
and a frame perfect left stick to airdodge down and right without double jumping to the right.
And then hit the 3 frame airdodge item throw.

<p>
If we play around with this clip a bit, we find that we don't need the airdodge at all!
This might be an easier clip.

<h2 id="item-throw-clip">DJ Item Throw Clip</h2>

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/dj-item-throw-clip.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>
Clip: Move into the corner. Jump and f1 double jump, then next frame hold right and item throw.

<p>
Unfortunately, this clip is still really hard!
We need a frame perfect left stick to move right after the double jump.
And we also need a frame perfect cstick throw input after the double jump.
We will clip back up if we are off.
The airdodge item throw clip might have had more inputs,
but fast double frame perfect analog inputs are hard and inconsistent.

<h2 id="aerial-clip">DJ Aerial Clip</h2>

<p>
There's nothing special about an item throw here.
We are using it to cancel our upwards double jump velocity,
but we can also cancel double jump velocity using aerials.

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/dj-aerial-clip.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>
Clip: Move into the corner. Jump and f1 double jump, then next frame hold right and input an aerial.

<p>
This setup isn't any easier, but it doesn't need a turnip.
For a long time I thought this was the easiest clip.
But we can do way better!

<p>
Aside: This method of clipping was <a href="https://xcancel.com/PracticalTAS/status/1924522992127602821">popularized (discovered?) by PracticalTas.</a>
He used an inconsistent tas-only setup.
I quickly improved his setup into this one and hit it legit.
That's how I started researching clip setups.

<h2 id="new-setup">The New Setup</h2>

<p>
If you practice the old hellish setup enough, you will eventually (by accident) do this:

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/dj-wacky-clip.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>

<p>Which is really really strange, because usually you double jump land like this:

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/djland-normal.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>

<p>
Somehow, we are clipping into the stage by just double jumping?
Since we spend more time below the floor with this wacky double jump, it could lead to easier setups.
How can we replicate this?

<p>
If we look into it, we find that the double jump clip occurs when Peach is very slightly further to the left than usual.
Here, the double jump clip works at -49.582, but not at -49.831.

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/djland-djclip-difference.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>

<p>
Getting this far left from walking is kinda random.
We need to walk fast for a single frame without entering dash.
The faster we walk, the further to the left we end up.
If we walk fast enough, the double jump clip works.

<p>
We can play around with every method to moving into the corner and see if they consistently move us far enough left.
The options are walking, dashing, running, wavedashing, dj landing, dash attacking, glide tossing, dash jc throwing,
dash jc grabbing, dash jc usmash, landing turnip throws, landing aerials, and dash turnip throw.

<p>
Only two work. The walk setup we used before, and dash turnip throw!

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/dash-turnip-setup.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>

<p>
Hooray! We found a consistent setup to get this wacky double jump clip.
We just need to turnip dash throw into the corner!
Because this wacky double jump causes us to be inside the stage for a good while, we should be able to clip more consistently.
How much more consistent are our old clip methods with this new strategy?

<h2 id="new-setup-aerial-clip">Aerial Clip with New Setup</h2>

<p>
Let's try the double jump aerial clip first:

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/new-setup-uair.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>
Clip: Turnip dash throw into the corner. Jump and f1 double jump, then hold right and uair at various timings. Here, we hold right f2 and uair f6.

<p>
Yes! The double jump aerial clip is more lenient with this new setup.
However, it's still really inconsistent. 
The timing of when this clip works is very complicated.
Different aerials work with different timings and it depends on when and how you drift.
And polling on the left stick can cause you to randomly fail or succeed.

<p>
Below are tables showing when each aerial works with this setup.
The column is the frame you input the aerial.
The row is the frame that you press right.
This assumes a perfect 1f right input with no intermediate polling.
Intermediate polling will change the table and it is currently impractical to test that.

<p>
I think the best setup is to use dair and aim for an early right press and a late dair press.
This gives us the most leeway and should be the most consistent.
And the later the cstick input, the easier it is on the right hand.

<h2 id="new-setup-item-throw-clip">Item Throw Clip with New Setup</h2>

<p>
Like with the old setup, we can also use a turnip throw instead of an aerial to cancel the dj momentum.

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/new-setup-fthrow.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>

<p>
I've only checked the fthrow table for now.
The other throws look very slightly less lenient than fthrow?
I will check in the future.

<h2 id="new-setup-airdodge-item-throw-clip">Airdodge Item Throw Clip with New Setup</h2>

<p>
Likewise, we can also try the airdodge item throw.
Because we have a large window to airdodge with the new setup, it's MUCH more lenient then the old setup.

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/new-setup-airdodge-dthrow.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>
Clip: Turnip dash throw into the corner. Jump and f1 double jump. Within 9 frames, airdodge down right and item throw in the next 3 frames.

<p>
Note that dthrow is slightly more lenient than other throws.
This setup is very consistent. The only frame perfect input is the double jump.
However, it is an awkward input because you need to release jump before the airdodge to avoid floating,
and there are a lot of buttons to press and sticks to move.
But when you get the timing down it should be pretty consistent.

<p>
The best part of this clip method?
Sometimes when you fail, you still clip!
If you mistime the airdodge press, you still throw the turnip and can get the dj throw clip.
And if you don't release jump before holding down right, you get a new type of clip - the dj float clip!

<h2 id="new-setup-float-clip">DJ Float Clip</h2>

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/new-setup-float-clip.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>
Clip: Turnip dash throw into the corner. Jump and f1 double jump. Hold down right to float, then quickly release jump to drop float.

<p>
The dj float clip is by far the easiest and most consistent method to clip.
However, it doesn't leave us with many options.
We need to use float and double jump to clip, so we can't do much while inside the stage.
It's impractical to grab the right ledge using this clip.
You can Up B to the right, waveland to the right, or aerial to the left.
You can also use Side B to get some momentum to either side.

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>

<p>
TLDR:
You can clip by walking into the corner, instant double jumping, then either item throwing, using an aerial, or airdodge item throwing.
These clips are really really hard and inconsistent.
By turnip dash throwing into the corner, you move slightly further left than usual.
From this position, our instant double jump will clip much more than usual.
Then, we can use the same setups from before and they will be way more lenient.
We can now also dj float clip, which is extremely lenient but gives us few options for fun after clipping.

<h2 id="how-clips-work">How Does Clipping Work?</h2>

<p>
So how do these clips work?

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/left-clip-collision.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>

<p>
Collision in a stage is made up of connected lines.
White lines are floors, blue lines are left-facing walls, green lines are right-facing walls, and red lines are ceilings.
This part of stadium lets us stand on a wall.
We can sometimes go downwards into a wall because it expects us to move into it from the side.
From here, we can move beneath the floor and clip into the stage to the right.
To be honest, I'm not sure about the specifics, I just try stuff until it works.

<h2 id="right-side-clip">Right Side Clip?</h2>

<p>
The above clips work because the wall is at an angle, not straight up and down.
This other part of the fire transformation has this property, can we clip here too?
All we should need to do is move downwards into the wall, then move right while beneath the stage.

<p><img loading="lazy" src=right-clip-collision.png />

<p>
I won't bore you with all the setups I tried.
I tried a billion different methods to clip, and,
turns out, we can clip with a simple airdodge!
I don't know why this hasn't been found before.

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/right-clip-airdodge.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>
Clip: Move up to wall. Shorthop and drift into the wall. Airdodge down right the frame before landing.

<h2 id="right-side-airdodge-item-throw">Right Side Clip Airdodge Item Throw</h2>

<p>
And when we airdodge, we can airdodge item throw!
I love airdodge item throw.
Because we airdodge when we are falling instead of rising, our retained velocity moves us down into the stage instead of back up in-bounds. 

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/right-clip-airdodge-item-throw.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>
Clip: Move up to wall. Shorthop and drift into the wall. Airdodge down right the frame before landing, then item throw in the next 3 frames.

<p>
I really have no clue why this hasn't been discovered before.
Maybe this is known, but I haven't seen anything on it.

<h2 id="yl-right-side-airdodge-item-throw">YL and Link's Right Side Clip</h2>

<p>
Link and Young Link can do this clip too, using bombs!
They need to shorthop from the little bottom dip instead of next to the wall though.

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/right-clip-airdodge-item-throw-YL.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>
Clip: Move into bottom dip. Shorthop and drift into the wall. Airdodge down right the frame before landing, then item throw in the next 3 frames.

<p>
Nice and simple!
Once you get the timing down this clip is pretty consistent.
Make sure that you press down right as late as possible.
It's around a 2 frame window.

<p>
I'm sure there are more setups to clip here, but this is the only one I could find.
If I understood how these clips worked better, I'm sure I could find more.

<h2 id="left-side-falling-clip">Left Side Falling Clip?</h2>

<p>
Remember that we can only airdodge item throw clip when we are falling.
Otherwise we pop up from beneath when our pre-airdodge velocity is restored.
On the left side, we solved this by airdodging after a double jump.
On the right side, we solved this by airdodging at the bottom of a short hop.
But we never checked if we could clip by airdodging after a short hop or another falling method on the left side!

<p>
Unfortunately, there's nowhere to shorthop from on the left side.
If you shorthop and try to fall into the wall, you just land on the platform.
But there's another method to fall - from float!

<h2 id="left-side-float-airdodge-clip">Left Side Float Airdodge Clip</h2>

<p>
Again, I tried a billion setups here.
But the setup that works is the simplest.
Run up to the wall, ground float, drop float, and airdodge item throw down right on the last falling frame.

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/float-airdodge-item-throw-clip.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>
Clip: Pull a turnip. Run into the wall and ground float. Drop float and hold down right.
Airdodge on the last frame before landing, then item throw in the next three frames.

<p>
This clip has A LOT going for it.
It's definitely the best left side clip if you don't need float.
You can throw just by pressing A and you will throw backwards, turning around to face the hidden inner ledge.
This avoids a tight analog cstick input.
Sometimes, the airdodge has a 2 frame window. Not sure when exactly.
After clipping you have a very large window to double jump to grab the hidden inner ledge.

<p>
There is one tricky part about this clip: having the right x velocity.
After airdodge item throwing, your velocity before the airdodge is retained.
If you are moving too fast to the left, you will clip in-bounds below the tree.
If you are moving too fast to the right, the airdodge won't clip into the stage.
I find the best method is to ground float with momentum to the left from dash jumping,
then start holding down right just before releasing float.
This seems to consistently give the correct x velocity.

<h2 id="parasol-dash">Parasol Dash from Hidden Ledge</h2>

<p>
Bonus:
Peach has a parasol dash from the hidden inner ledge.
You can grab this ledge using parasol after clipping.
The spacing is tricky because you can't see anything, but you should be able to get it down.
After grabbing this ledge from parasol, quickly release ledge, double jump, then airdodge straight up.
It's slightly more lenient than a regular parasol dash.

<p><video preload=metadata src=/blog/new-fire-tform-clips/right-clip-parasol-dash.mp4 loop muted disablepictureinpicture disableremoteplayback playsinline type=video/mp4></video>

<h2 id="tldr2">TLDR</h2>

<p>
And that's every method I know to clip into stadium by yourself after the transformation has settled!
There are 8 methods from 4 different setups in total:

<ol>
    <li>Left side, no setup:
        <ul>
            <li>wavedash (easy, consistent, dead)</li>
            <li>instant dj aerial/item throw (hard, inconsistent, fun)</li>
            <li>instant dj airdodge item throw (hard, inconsistent, fun)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Left side, turnip dash throw setup:
        <ul>
            <li>instant dj aerial/item throw (hard, inconsistent, fun)</li>
            <li>instant dj airdodge item throw (hard, consistent, fun)</li>
            <li>instant dj float (easy, consistent, meh)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Left side, dash ground float setup:
        <ul>
            <li>drop float, airdodge item throw (easy, consistent, fun)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Right side, shorthop setup:
        <ul>
            <li>airdodge item throw (easy, consistent, fun)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="todo">What Should You Learn?</h2>

<p>
I suggest you start by practicing the ground float airdodge clip first.
Just run and ground float into the corner, then fall and airdodge down right item throw.
It's easy and consistent when you get the timing down!

<p>
If you want float after clipping, learn the right-side airdodge item throw clip.
This one is also pretty easy and very simple, but can be inconsistent.

<p>
Enjoy!
