Mixup Map
</h1>

"Mixup" is the new "Mindgames".
They are both broad terms - useful as categories, but not pointed and actionable.
It doesn't really make sense to "improve your mixups".
I think you need to understand the variants of mixups, their different properties, and how to exploit them
in order to improve your mixups in melee.
