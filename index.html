<h1>Hi, I'm Aitch!</h1>

I'm a programmer. I create tools and mods for the game Super Smash Bros. Melee.
I'm the author of
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rwing-aitch.bsky.social/post/3leuriuc5qc2y">rwing</a>
and the organizer and main contributer to
<a href="https://github.com/AlexanderHarrison/TrainingMode-CommunityEdition">
Training Mode - Community Edition</a>.

<p>

I also work on a lot of smaller tools.
I wrote a text editor, <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderHarrison/edit">edit</a>, which I daily drive.
I wrote a graphics programming wrapper, <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderHarrison/ezcompute">ezcompute</a>,
which makes writing small graphics visualizations and programs much simpler.
I have a ton of small melee tools:
a <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderHarrison/slp_parser">slp replay parser</a>,
a <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderHarrison/slpz">compressed slp format</a>,
an <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderHarrison/gc_fst">iso filesystem editor</a>,
an <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderHarrison/tm_replay">TM recording gci file creator</a>,
a <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderHarrison/slp_combo_finder">combo finder</a>,
a <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderHarrison/cdat">dat file editor</a>,
and a <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderHarrison/dat_extractor">melee assets extractor</a>, 

<p>

I'm a melee player.
I'm active in the Edmonton and larger Alberta scenes.
I main Peach, because I enjoy pressing buttons, labbing and practicing niche tech,
and being able to take breaks without getting demolished because I misinputted.
I should make the 2025 Alberta PR (mostly because half the 2024 PR quit).
I don't have a particular favourite matchups, but I strongly dislike fighting
campy sheiks, puffs, and spacies.

<p>

Most of my time is spent working on rwing and TM-CE these days.
